# Leaflet-challenge

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.

Level 1: Basic Visualization

* Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

* The data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth will appear darker in color.

* Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

* Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.


Level 2: More Data (Optional)

* Plot a second data set on the map.

* Add a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out the two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.

* Add layer controls to our map.
